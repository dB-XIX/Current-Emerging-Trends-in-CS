# Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

We were given all of the code except for the qtrain() function in the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb file. We were responsible for creating a deep Q-learning training function for the intelligent agent.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists specialize in developing and implementing computer systems and software to advance the human race. They are problem solvers.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I gather information regarding the problem, outline a plan of action to address all aspects, and then take action. Afterward, I reflect on what worked, what didn't, and what could be better, then implement those strategies. All of this works in a constant improvement feedback loop.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethical responsibilites to the end user and the organization include delivering a quality product that is true to its description, not divulging sensitive information, and collecting and storing information from users under appropriate guidelines.
