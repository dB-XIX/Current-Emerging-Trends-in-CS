# Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science

## Project Overview

### Work Completed
In this project, we worked on the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb file. While most of the code was provided, we were tasked with developing the **qtrain()** function, which is responsible for deep Q-learning training for the intelligent agent. This involved implementing a robust training loop to enable the agent to learn and make optimal decisions within the game environment.
